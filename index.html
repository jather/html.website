<h1> Officially a web developer. </h1>
<p> Since I've learned how HTML works, I can already create a basic webpage! I might as well use the skills I've learnt to log the progress I'm making.</p>
<ul> <strong>Things I've done so far:</strong>
  <li> Learned basic html and CSS. I'm learning from <a href="freecodecamp.org"> freecodecamp.</a>
  <li> Bought the juyong.me domain
  <li> Set up my website on Github pages, and created this html document as the index page. 
</ul>
<ol> <strong> Next steps: </strong>
  <li> Learn more CSS, and then start learning javascript. 
  <li> Finish writing out the home page and about page for my website and publish it. At this point I can call it an actual website.
  <li> Learn React.js, because I want to eventually build my website on Gatsby. 
  <li> Write more of the content.
</ol>
