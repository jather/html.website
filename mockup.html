<h1> “Home” page</h1>
<p>Home is a special kind of place. And place is a special kind of space. One that we ascribe with meaning.  (... Yifu Tuan...)</p>
<p>Meaning and value are the basis of our self-identity.  (...self-identity...)</p>
<p>The meaning in home is safety. Nurturing. Growth. Belonging.</p>
<p>That's why home is an important part of who we are, it embodies values which we hold most dearly. It reminds us that there's a part of ourself that isn't quite captured by how we are perceived socially, how we present ourselves in public, or even in the way we think of ourselves. (...)</p>
<p>This is my 'home page', an attempt to carve out my own place from the internet space, the <span class="glow">digital landscape.</span> A place that isn't a storefront, a workplace, or a public forum, but a home, a place of my own. If we are to take our digital identities seriously, which I argue that we should, then we should take control of it, be authors and coders and thinkers, not just users, consumers, and spectators.</p>
