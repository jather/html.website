<h1> “Home” page </h1> 
<p><span class="glow">Home</span> is a special kind of place. And <span class="glow">place</span> is a special kind of <span class="glow">space</span>. One that we ascribe with meaning.  (... Yifu Tuan...)</p>
<p><span class="glow">Meaning</span> and <span class="glow">value</span> are the basis of our <span class="glow">self-identity.</span>  (...self-identity...)</p>
<p>The meaning in <span class="glow">home</span> is safety. Nurturing. Growth. <span class="glow">Belonging.</span></p>
<p>That's why home is an important part of who we are, it embodies values which we hold most dearly. It reminds us that there's <span class="glow">a part of ourself that isn't quite captured</span> by how we are perceived socially, how we present ourselves in public, or even in the way we think of ourselves. (...)</p>
<p>This is my 'home page', an attempt to <span class="glow">carve out my own place from the internet space</span>, the digital landscape. A place that isn't a storefront, a workplace, or a public forum, but a home, a place of my own. If we are to take our digital identities seriously, which I argue that we should, then we should take control of it, be authors and coders and thinkers, not just users, consumers, and spectators.</p>
