<h1> Now </h1>
<main>
<p>I'm in Jeju, and right now it's still uncertain whether or not I'll be returning to the UK for uni in September, because if it's going to be online classes then I could end up staying here. Right now I'm working on this website, going to the gym, and trying to prepare myself for uni. I'm hanging out on Discord a lot.</p>
<h2> What is a “now page”?</h2>
<p>The idea is that's it's a page that gives an idea of what I'm up to <em>now,</em> a page that answers the question of "what are you up to these days?". Sort of like how it's convention to have an "/about" page and a "/contact" page. I think it's a pretty new trend/culture/movement in personal websites. Credit to <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> for starting it.  More on "now pages", and to also see examples of it on other websites: <a href= "https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a> </p>
