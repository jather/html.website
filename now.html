<h1> Now </h1>
<main>
<p>I'm in Jeju, and right now it's still uncertain whether or not I'll be returning to the UK for uni in September, because if it's going to be online classes then I could end up staying here. Right now I'm working on this website, going to the gym, and trying to prepare myself for uni. I'm hanging out on Discord a lot.</p>
<p>I got the idea for a "now page" from Derek Sivers. The idea is that's it's a page on a personal website that gives an idea of what I'm up to <em>now,</em> a page that answers the question of "what are you up to these days?". Sort of like how it's convention for websites to have an /about page and a /contact page. The "now page" fills a slightly different need and I think it's a concept that's starting to gain popularity.
