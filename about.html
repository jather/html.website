<h1 > About me</h1>
 <p> I'm Juyong, I'm 21 years old. I made this website as a place where I can share my thoughts on things I care about. I'm currently going into my second year of study for English Literature. I'm from Korea. </p> 
  <h2> About this website</h2>
  <p> This website is a work in progress, as writing project, a coding project, and a design project. I'm learning as I go. The current version of the wesite is built from scratch using basic html and css. </p>
  <ul> <strong>Progress so far:</strong>
    <li> Learned basic html and CSS. I'm learning from freecodecamp. Here's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/juyong"> my portfolio</a> where you can see my progress.
    <li> Bought the juyong.me domain.
    <li> Built the barebones of a website and got it hosted using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.
  </ul>
  <ol> <strong> Next steps: </strong>
    <li> Keep learning more code from FCC- finish the webdev projects, and move onto javascript. 
    <li> Finish writing out the home page, the about page, and the now page. 
    <li> Write more content. 
    <li> Make the website responsive.</li>
    <li> Learn React.js and re-build my website on Gatsby? 
  </ol>
  <h3>Design considerations</h3>
  <p>In the process of making this website I've had to make a lot of decisions, some of them coming from my own experience using websites, and some of them things I had never considered before. For example, I ended up putting a lot of thought into the applications and implications of using a dark theme for my website. I'm currently still in the process of figuring out how to structure my website. Section breaks, side notes, nested parentheses. </p>
